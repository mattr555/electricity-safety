					The circuits in your home are considered to be "parallel" circuits.<br>
					There are multiple circuits for different parts of your home; like one for the water heater, one for the kitchen, and one for the bathroom, for example.<br>
					This means that the same amount of power is delivered to each item.<br>
					This amount of power is measured in volts. In the United States, this value is 120 V.<br><br>
					However, this also means that the current of the electricity is broken up.<br>
					This explains why the lights dim when you turn a vacuum or a hair dryer on. These high-powered items draw more current that is taken away from the other circuits in your house.

				<div class="col-lg-6 copy">
					Your circuit box may look like this. It has a main switch that controls all the power going into the house.<br>
					It also has a circuit breaker for each circuit in your home. This allows you to switch off only part of the power going into your house when working with electrical components.<br>
					It is a good idea to figure out which breakers control which components to eliminate guessing when in use<br><br>
					<b>Safety tip:</b> You should <em>always</em> switch off the power to a circuit when you're working with potentially live wires, such as with a stove or oven replacement.

			Your home probably already has some features built in to the circuit box. <br>
			These help to reduce the chance of an electrical fire if too much power is used.

				<div class="col-lg-6 copy">
					When too much current is drawn from the circuit, wires may heat up through a process called <em>Joule heating</em> and begin to melt or burn, causing an electrical fire.<br>
					To combat this, circuit breakers are used. Electricity flows through an electromagnet (a magnet that uses electricity to work).<br>
					Enough current will be able to pull the switch down, disconnecting the circuit from the main power and preventing a fire.<br>
					These are advantageous because they are easy to switch and don't have to be replaced every time too much current is drawn.

		<div class="title">Fuses</div>
		<div class="container">
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-lg-6 copy">
					Older circuit boxes may have fuses, which work like incandescent light bulbs.<br>
					Here, thin wire filaments heat up like in a light bulb. If too much current is drawn, the wire will get too hot and disintegrate.<br>
					If a fuse is "blown," it will need to be replaced.<br>
					Fuses are also found in cars.

					Electricity wants to travel to where it is more spread out.<br>
					This is why lightning wants to move from a crowded cloud to the ground.<br>
					In the same way, electricity wants to move from it's cramped wires and components to a place more spread out. When you are working in a circuit box, that place may be you.<br>
					To make sure that a worker doesn't experience an electric shock by touching the wrong things, the circuit box is "grounded" to the earth with a wire. This creates a pathway to a more spread out location when work is done on a circuit.<br><br>
					Grounding wires are also used with lightning rods to disperse the energy if it is hit. The electricity will dissipate into the ground, rather than into the house.

				<li>Make sure the area is safe for entry</li>
				<li>Do <b>NOT</b> touch a victim who is in immediate contact with the source of electricity.</li>
				<li>Try to turn off the main source of energy with the circuit box. If this is not doable, use a non-conductive material, like wood, to separate the victim from the source of electricity</li>
				<li>Call 9-1-1</li>
				<li>Begin to perform CPR if the breathing or heartbeat appears to be affected by the electricity.</li>
